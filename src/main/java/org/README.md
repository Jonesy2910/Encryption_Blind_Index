## What was used? ‚úçÔ∏è

*  ``Java``
*  ``BouncyCastle Cryptographic Library``
*  ``MySQL``
*  ``JPanel``
*  ``AES``
*  ``HMACSHA256``

## Setup üìö

#### 1. Create a two tables in MySQL and call them users and information
```
CREATE TABLE `information` (
  `ID` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `date` varbinary(255) NOT NULL,
  `date_index` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `expense_type` varbinary(255) NOT NULL,
  `expense_type_index` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `expense_area` varbinary(255) NOT NULL,
  `expense_area_index` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `supplier` varbinary(255) NOT NULL,
  `supplier_index` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `transaction_number` varbinary(255) NOT NULL,
  `transaction_number_index` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `amount` varbinary(255) NOT NULL,
  `amount_index` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `description` varbinary(255) NOT NULL,
  `supplier_postcode` varbinary(255) NOT NULL,
  `supplier_postcode_index` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `expenditure_type` varbinary(255) NOT NULL,
  `expenditure_type_index` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `iv` varbinary(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`ID`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=116 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```
```
CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `username` varchar(30) NOT NULL,
  `password` varchar(30) NOT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

#### 2. Add a record to the users table that is shorter than 30 characters for username and password

#### 3. Use the excel spreadsheet that has the information for the database to be imported directly into the file using table wizard in MySQL.

#### 4. Change the key locations and log location with a suitable file locations for the textfile to be saved to your device. Requires values changed in systemSetup and SystemManagement classes

For Example:

```
Path path = Paths.get("D:\\Desktop\\Key_Location\\AES_key.txt");

String hmacKeyFilePath = "D:\\Projects\\Blind_Index\\src\\main\\java\\org\\key_location\\HMAC_key.txt";

```

#### 5. In the RunSystem class file. 

This should full create the system so that the program can be used and launch the LoginGUI.

## Future Work üîÆ

#### 1. Make the GUI more appealing to the user.
#### 2. Make the user be able to register to the company with some form of validation if the user works for the company
#### 3. Work on way to stop SQL Injection 
#### 4. Check for other vulnerabilities
#### 5. Comment code for better documentation
#### 6. Look into how to store the encryption keys on AWS so they are more secure

## What I Learned üßë‚Äçüéì


## The Process üë©üèΩ‚Äçüç≥  
I started by rendering a canvas with rough.js to create the base for all the drawings. Then, I focused on drawing on the canvas, allowing users to make lines, rectangles, and other shapes.

Next, I made sure users could move elements around. This was important for adjusting drawings. After that, I added the ability to resize elements to give more control over the shapes.

To make sure mistakes could be fixed, I implemented undo and redo features. I also added freehand drawing for a more natural sketching experience and a text tool to label or note on the canvas.

To navigate larger drawings, I put in pan and zoom tools. With everything functioning, I designed the whole UI to make it user-friendly and appealing.

Finally, I added testing with Cypress and Testing Library. I conducted end-to-end tests on drawing and manipulating text, lines, rectangles, and freehand drawings to make sure everything worked smoothly.

Along the way, while building everything, I took notes on what I've learned so I don't miss out on it. I also documented the behind-the-scenes processes every time a feature was added.

This way, I understood what I've built. The funny thing is, as soon as I started to document what happened behind the scenes and the features I've added, it made me realize that we fully understand something once we've actually taken a step back, thought about it, and documented what we've done. I think this is a good practice to follow when learning something new.
